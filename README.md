# Technical stack

- ## Vite

  Allow to rapidly setup a fast dev & bundler environment.

- ## TypeScript

  For type safety as it's more robust & reliable than PropTypes, even if it's less simple to handle.

- ## React

  My favorite "framework" for frontend application.

- ## CSS Modules

  Allow to scope style to prevent classes conflicts.

- ## PostCSS
  Lighter than Sass, as it's composable and allow some sugar syntax as nesting, imports, autoprefixing, etc.
