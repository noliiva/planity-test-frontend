# Planity Test Frontend

Integration of Box RDV component for Planity's job interview.

# Demo

You can see the live project here: https://demo.noliiva.com/

# Technical stack

- ### Vite

  Allow to rapidly setup a fast dev & bundler environment.

- ### TypeScript

  For type safety as it's more robust & reliable than PropTypes, even if it's less simple to handle.

- ### React

  My favorite "framework" for frontend application.

- ### CSS Modules

  Allow to scope styles to prevent classes conflicts.

- ### PostCSS

  Lighter than Sass, as it's composable and allow some sugar syntax as nesting, imports, autoprefixing, etc.
